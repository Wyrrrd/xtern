**Download cacerts.pem** \\
Some systems, in particular Windows, may require the manual installation of certificates for SSL.  If this is your case you can download the certificate here. Then set the ''ca_required'' setting to true in the Configuration Manager so that the downloaded certificates become active.  The cacerts.pem file must be periodically updated.\\
**Check links** \\
You can check for broken links on the entire wiki or you can check by namespace.  The latter might be preferable, or even necessary, on a large wiki. Clicking on the wiki pagename in the broken link list opens a new window with the page open for editing.  Clicking the ''Review'' button makes it possible to re-check the broken links at a later time.
